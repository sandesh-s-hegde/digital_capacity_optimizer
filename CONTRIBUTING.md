# Contributing to the Financial Digital Twin Project

Thank you for your interest in this research artifact.

## Research Context
This repository serves as the executable artifact for the **"Pixels to Premiums"** research initiative. As such, the codebase is currently maintained exclusively by the primary author for the purpose of academic assessment and validation.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter unexpected behavior during the simulation or "Sandbox Mode," please open an Issue in this repository with the following details:
1. The inputs used (e.g., Lead Time Variance, Holding Cost).
2. The specific behavior observed vs. expected behavior.
3. Any error logs from the Streamlit debug console.

## Future Roadmap
Post-assessment, this repository may be opened for community contributions regarding:
* Integration with real-time ERP APIs (SAP/Oracle).
* Advanced computer vision modules for volatility estimation.
* Enhanced reinforcement learning agents for multi-echelon optimization.
