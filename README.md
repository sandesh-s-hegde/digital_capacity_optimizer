## 🧮 Methodological Framework

### 1. The Newsvendor Logic
[cite_start]The core optimisation engine moves beyond static averages to determine the **Critical Ratio** ($\alpha^*$) based on cost asymmetry:

$$\alpha^{*} = \frac{C_{u}}{C_{u} + C_{o}}$$

Where:
* $C_{u}$: Cost of Underage (Lost Profit Margin)
* $C_{o}$: Cost of Overage (Holding Cost + Obsolescence)

### 2. Volatility Modelling
To account for supply chain volatility, the system calculates **Risk-Adjusted Safety Stock** using a Root Sum of Squares (RSS) approach, integrating both demand variability ($\sigma_{D}$) and lead time variability ($\sigma_{LT}$):

$$\text{Safety Stock} = Z_{\alpha}\sqrt{(\overline{L}\sigma_{D}^{2})+(\overline{D}^{2}\sigma_{LT}^{2})}$$

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 1. Intelligent Dashboard
* **Multi-Product Support:** Track distinct SKUs ("Widget A", "Widget B") with isolated data.
* **AI Forecasting:** Projects future demand using Linear Regression trend lines.
* **Visual Analytics:** Interactive charts built with Plotly.

### 🚁 2. Executive Command Center
* **"Watchtower" View:** Scans your entire database to flag products as **🟢 Normal**, **🔴 Surge Alert**, or **🟡 Low Velocity**.
* **Instant Health Check:** See the status of your entire inventory at a glance.

### 🚢 3. Stochastic Risk Engine
* **Lead Time Uncertainty:** Models "Supply Chain Chaos" (e.g., shipping delays) to calculate required Safety Stock.
* **Service Level Planning:** Adjust your desired SLA (e.g., 95% vs 99%) and see the cost impact instantly.

### 💰 4. Profit Optimizer
* **Scenario Heatmaps:** Visualizes the "Sweet Spot" between Ordering Too Much (Holding Cost) vs. Too Little (Stockout Cost).
* **Unit Economics:** Calculates profit margins based on manufacturing cost vs. retail price.

### 🛠️ 5. Data Management Tools
* **Bulk Importer:** Upload CSV files to ingest historical data in seconds.
* **Factory Reset:** "Danger Zone" feature to wipe the database and reset ID counters for testing.
* **CRUD Operations:** Add, View, and Delete individual records.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture
The system is built on a cloud-native Python stack, designed for scalability and auditability.

* **Core Logic:** Stochastic calculus for Safety Stock (RSS method) & EOQ optimization.
* **Intelligence Layer:** Google Gemini AI (via `ai_brain.py`) for contextual volatility analysis.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Cloud) for persistent transaction logging.
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (React-based) for interactive simulation.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

You need a [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Option A: Run Locally (Python)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandesh-s-hegde/digital_capacity_optimizer.git
cd digital_capacity_optimizer

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set your API Key (Create a .env file)
# GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# 4. Launch the Dashboard
streamlit run app.py

```

### Option B: Bulk Upload Format

To import data via CSV, your file must have these headers:

```csv
date,product_name,demand
2024-01-01,Laptop Pro,120
2024-02-01,Laptop Pro,145
2024-03-01,Laptop Pro,130

```
